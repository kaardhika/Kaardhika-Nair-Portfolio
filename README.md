# [PROJECT 1:Empowering Survivors: Analyzing Employment Data for Individuals Impacted by Sexual Slavery](https://github.com/kaardhika/Empowering-Survivors)

At Transform Engine, my internship has focused on leveraging technology to create meaningful social impact specifically for those impacted by sexual slavery. Transform engine is a technology-based workplace that transforms the lives of survivors of modern slavery, abuse and those at higher risk of exploitation through long-term employment and support. Inspired by this work, this project analyzes data from Transform Engine. The goal is to explore trends in employment, retention rates, and skill development to better understand the social and economic impact of providing survivors with meaningful work. This analysis will help identify which factors lead to successful long-term employment and areas for improvement. By building a SQL database and performing data analysis, I aim to provide actionable insights for NGOs and social enterprises dedicated to helping survivors transition into stable, independent lives.
